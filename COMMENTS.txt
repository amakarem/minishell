after execution is done:
- check why heredoc fails in tester
- check if signals work with heredoc
- check what happens to expansion when PATH is unset or new var is added with export
- check if signals work while input after minishell> is written
Type a command line, then use ctrl-C and press "Enter". The buffer should be clean and there should be
nothing left to execute.
- check forbidden functions: nm -g ./minishell | grep " U " (from https://github.com/jotavare/minishell)
